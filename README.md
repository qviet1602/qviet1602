Hi! My name is Jason Nguyen. 
I am currently working as a data analyst at the University of Washington. In my current job, I am responsible for developing and maintaining an ETL pipeline to minimize data loss. I also designed and built interactive visualization dashboards to be used for model diagnostics and comparison in time series analysis to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in large datasets. In addition, I have a master degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech. At Georgia Tech, I worked on many projects involving all aspects of analytics ranging from data visualization to predictive modeling to big data analysis. Welcome to my GitHub Page!
